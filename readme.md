# Hi! I'm Alexei! Full Stack Developer

## About Me:

I am Fernando, a passionate Digital artist specialised in 3D character creation. For me, each project is an opportunity to explore new techniques and experiment with different styles. Whether I'm working on animation projects, video games, 3D printing, or advertising, I strive to create works that are not only visually stunning but also convey deep emotions and narratives.
